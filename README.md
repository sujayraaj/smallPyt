# SmallPyt

A slow raytracer written in python. Inspired by 100 line C++ Raytracer smallpt by Kevin Beason ( http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/ ).

Using pypy instead of regular python makes it atleast usable. Still the sampling is too low to make a usable image, checkout im.png. It took
around 2 minutes to render im.png.

Renders at 512 x 368 pixels at 64 samples per pixel by default. The values are hard-coded.
