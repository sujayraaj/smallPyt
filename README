A python port of the 100 line C++ Raytracer smallpt by Kevin Beason. (http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)
Is just an experimental project with little interest in further exploration (because it is very slow?).

Renders at 512 x 368 pixels at 64 samples per pixel by default. The values are hard-coded.

This code is released under GPL v2.

TODO: To upload the time and the scene once it finishes rendering
